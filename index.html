            <p>
              You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains.
              But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning
              and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the
              Web Development Hero.

            <p>
              I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple
              website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website.
              My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

              They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
              developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
              it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
              Hero.
